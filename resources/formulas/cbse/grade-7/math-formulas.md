## Chapter 1: Integers

| Rule | Formula |
|------|---------|
| Closure (Addition) | a + b is always an integer |
| Commutative (Addition) | a + b = b + a |
| Associative (Addition) | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) |
| Additive Identity | a + 0 = a |
| Additive Inverse | a + (-a) = 0 |

**Sign Rules for Multiplication/Division:**

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| (+) × (+) or (+) ÷ (+) | (+) |
| (+) × (−) or (+) ÷ (−) | (−) |
| (−) × (+) or (−) ÷ (+) | (−) |
| (−) × (−) or (−) ÷ (−) | (+) |

- Zero property: a × 0 = 0
- Multiplicative identity: a × 1 = a
- a ÷ 0 is **undefined**
- 0 ÷ a = 0 (where a ≠ 0)

## Chapter 2: Fractions

- **Mixed to improper:** a b/c = (a × c + b) / c
- **Improper to mixed:** Divide numerator by denominator → quotient = whole part, remainder = new numerator
- **Equivalent fractions:** a/b = (a × n) / (b × n)
- **Addition (unlike):** a/b + c/d = (ad + bc) / bd
- **Multiplication:** a/b × c/d = ac / bd
- **Division:** a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c (multiply by reciprocal)
- **Reciprocal** of a/b = b/a
- **Comparing:** Find LCM of denominators, convert, then compare numerators

---

## Chapter 3: Decimals

- 0.1 = 1/10, 0.01 = 1/100, 0.001 = 1/1000
- **Decimal to fraction:** Write digits as numerator, denominator = 10^(decimal places)
- **Multiplying by 10:** Shift decimal 1 place right
- **Multiplying by 100:** Shift decimal 2 places right
- **Multiplying by 1000:** Shift decimal 3 places right
- **Decimal places in product** = sum of decimal places in both factors

## Chapter 4: Rational Numbers

- **Rational number:** p/q where p, q are integers and q ≠ 0
- **Standard form:** Denominator is positive, HCF(|p|, q) = 1
- **Addition:** a/b + c/d = (ad + bc) / bd
- **Multiplication:** a/b × c/d = ac / bd
- **Division:** a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c
- **Comparing:** Cross multiply — if ad > bc then a/b > c/d

- **Multiplying variables:** xᵐ × xⁿ = xᵐ⁺ⁿ
- **Distributive property:** a(b + c) = ab + ac

## Chapter 7: Linear Equations in One Variable

  - Addition ↔ Subtraction
  - Multiplication ↔ Division
- **Balance principle:** Whatever you do to one side, do to the other
- **Always verify:** Substitute answer back into original equation

---

## Chapter 8: Ratio and Proportion

- **Simplest form:** Divide both terms by their HCF
- **Dividing Q in ratio a:b:**
  - First part = Q × a/(a+b)
  - Second part = Q × b/(a+b)
- **Proportion:** a:b :: c:d means a/b = c/d
- **Product of extremes = Product of means:** a × d = b × c
- **Mean proportion** of a and b = √(ab)

---

## Chapter 9: Unitary Method

- **Direct variation** (more → more):
  - Cost of 1 unit = Total cost / Number of units
  - Cost of n units = (Cost of 1 unit) × n
- **Inverse variation** (more → less):
  - Product is constant: workers × days = constant
  - If a workers take b days, then n workers take (a × b)/n days
