## Chapter 3: Energy

### Work

| W = 0 | No displacement (pushing a wall) |
| W = 0 | Force perpendicular to displacement (carrying bag horizontally) |

- **SI unit:** 1 Joule (J) = 1 Newton × 1 metre
- 1 calorie = 4.18 Joules

### Energy

| Type | Formula | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Potential Energy | PE = mgh | Energy due to height/position |
| Kinetic Energy | KE = ½mv² | Energy due to motion |

- **Law of Conservation:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted
- Total energy = KE + PE = constant (in ideal case)

### Common Energy Conversions

| Device | Conversion |
|--------|-----------|
| Electric heater | Electrical → Heat |
| Solar cell | Light → Electrical |
| Loudspeaker | Electrical → Sound |
| Photosynthesis | Light → Chemical |
| Hydroelectric dam | Potential → Kinetic → Electrical |
| Car engine | Chemical → Heat → Mechanical |

## Chapter 4: Light Energy

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Luminous body | Produces its own light (Sun, candle, stars) |
| Non-luminous body | Reflects light (Moon, mirror) |
| Transparent | Light passes through, objects visible clearly |
| Translucent | Partial light, objects blurry |
| Opaque | Blocks light completely |

### Types of Beams

| Beam | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Parallel | Rays travel side by side (distant source) |
| Convergent | Rays meet at a point |
| Divergent | Rays spread out from a point |

### Laws of Reflection

1. Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection (∠i = ∠r)
2. Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane

### Image in Plane Mirror

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Size | Same as object |
| Nature | Virtual and erect |
| Position | Behind mirror, same distance as object |
| Orientation | Laterally inverted |

## Chapter 5: Heat

### Units

- SI unit of heat: Joule (J)
- 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 1000 calories
- 1 calorie = 4.18 Joules

### Changes of State

| Change | Direction | Heat |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Melting/Fusion | Solid → Liquid | Absorbed |
| Vaporization/Boiling | Liquid → Gas | Absorbed |
| Condensation | Gas → Liquid | Released |
| Freezing | Liquid → Solid | Released |
| Sublimation | Solid → Gas (directly) | Absorbed |

- Melting point of ice = 0°C = 32°F = 273 K
- Boiling point of water = 100°C = 212°F = 373 K

### Temperature Conversions

| From | To | Formula |
|------|----|---------|
| °C | °F | °F = (9/5 × °C) + 32 |
| °F | °C | °C = 5/9 × (°F − 32) |
| °C | K | K = °C + 273 |

- Normal body temperature: 37°C = 98.6°F = 310 K
- °C and °F are equal at: −40°

### Thermal Expansion

- Order of expansion: **Gases > Liquids > Solids**
- **Linear expansion:** Increase in length
- **Superficial expansion:** Increase in area
- **Cubical expansion:** Increase in volume

### Modes of Heat Transfer

| Mode | Medium | Mechanism | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Conduction | Solids | Particles vibrate, don't move | Hot spoon |
| Convection | Fluids (liquid/gas) | Particles actually move | Boiling water |
| Radiation | No medium needed | Electromagnetic waves | Sunlight |

**Conductors and Insulators:**
- Good conductors: Silver, copper, aluminium, iron
- Bad conductors: Wood, plastic, rubber, glass, air, wool

## Chapter 6: Sound

### Production and Propagation

- Sound is produced by **vibrating objects**
- Sound **needs a medium** (cannot travel in vacuum)
- Sound travels as **longitudinal waves**

| Medium | Speed |
|--------|-------|
| Air | ~332 m/s |
| Water | ~1500 m/s |
| Steel | ~5100 m/s |

**Speed order:** Solids > Liquids > Gases

### Characteristics of Sound

| Property | Depends On | Unit |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Frequency (f) | Vibrations per second | Hz (Hertz) |
| Time Period (T) | Time for one vibration | seconds |
| Amplitude | Max displacement from mean | metres |
| Loudness | Amplitude | — |
| Pitch | Frequency | — |
| Quality/Timbre | Waveform (overtones) | — |

- **f = 1/T** and **T = 1/f**

### Sound Classification

| Category | Frequency Range |
|----------|----------------|
| Infrasonic | Below 20 Hz |
| Audible (human) | 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz |
| Ultrasonic | Above 20,000 Hz |

- **Echo:** Sound reflection from a surface at least ~17 m away

## Chapter 7: Electricity and Magnetism

### Magnetism

- Like poles **repel** (N-N, S-S)
- Unlike poles **attract** (N-S)
- **Repulsion is the sure test** of magnetism
- Ferromagnetic materials: Iron, Nickel, Cobalt
- Breaking a magnet → each piece becomes a complete magnet (N + S)

### Electric Circuits

| Circuit Type | Current | Voltage | If one component fails |
|-------------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Series | Same everywhere | Divides among components | All stop working |
| Parallel | Divides among branches | Same across all branches | Others keep working |

- **Closed circuit:** Current flows (complete path)
- **Open circuit:** No current (broken path)
- Indian household voltage: 220V AC, parallel wiring
