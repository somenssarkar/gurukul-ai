          - problem: "Two dice are thrown together. Find the probability that the sum of numbers on both dice is 8."
            answer: "5/36"
            solution_steps:
              - "Total outcomes when two dice are thrown = 6 × 6 = 36"
              - "Favourable outcomes (sum = 8): (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2)"
              - "Number of favourable outcomes = 5"
              - "P(sum = 8) = 5/36"
