        common_misconceptions:
          - "Subtracting a negative number makes the result smaller (it actually makes it larger)"
          - "Zero is not an integer (zero IS an integer - it's between positive and negative integers)"
          - "Adding a negative is different from subtracting a positive (they are the same: a + (-b) = a - b)"
        key_formulas:
          - "Closure: a + b is always an integer (if a and b are integers)"
          - "Commutative: a + b = b + a"

          - problem: "Verify: Is subtraction commutative? Check if 8 - 3 = 3 - 8"
            answer: "No, subtraction is not commutative. 8 - 3 = 5 but 3 - 8 = -5"
            solution_steps:
              - "LHS: 8 - 3 = 5"
