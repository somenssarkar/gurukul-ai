          - problem: "A tuning fork vibrates 512 times per second. Find its frequency and time period."
            answer: "Frequency = 512 Hz, Time period = 0.00195 s"
            solution_steps:
              - "Frequency = number of vibrations per second = 512 Hz"
              - "Time period = 1/frequency = 1/512 = 0.00195 s (approximately)"
            difficulty: 1
            indian_context: "A tuning fork used in your school music class."

          - problem: "A bat emits ultrasonic waves of frequency 50,000 Hz. Can humans hear this sound? Why?"
            answer: "No. 50,000 Hz is above the human audible range (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz)."
            solution_steps:
              - "Human hearing range: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz"
              - "Bat's frequency: 50,000 Hz"
              - "50,000 Hz > 20,000 Hz → ultrasonic"
              - "Humans cannot hear ultrasonic sounds"
              - "But bats can — they use it for echolocation (finding objects in the dark)"
            difficulty: 1
            indian_context: "Bats are common in old Indian buildings and temples — they navigate using ultrasound."

          - problem: "You shout towards a cliff and hear the echo after 4 seconds. How far is the cliff? (Speed of sound = 340 m/s)"
            answer: "680 m"
            solution_steps:
              - "Sound travels to the cliff AND back in 4 seconds"
              - "Total distance = speed × time = 340 × 4 = 1360 m"
              - "This is the round trip distance (to cliff and back)"
              - "Distance to cliff = 1360/2 = 680 m"
            difficulty: 2
            indian_context: "Shouting 'echo!' in a valley in the Western Ghats or at a hill station."

          - problem: "Why does a tabla produce a different sound from a flute even when both play the same note?"
            answer: "Because of the difference in quality/timbre. Each instrument produces a different combination of overtones (harmonics), giving it a unique 'voice'."
            solution_steps:
              - "Both can play the same note (same fundamental frequency = same pitch)"
              - "But each instrument produces different overtones/harmonics"
              - "The combination of fundamental + overtones gives each instrument its unique quality"
              - "This property is called timbre or quality of sound"
              - "That's why you can tell instruments apart even with eyes closed"
            difficulty: 2
            indian_context: "A tabla, sitar, and flute all playing the same raga — each sounds distinct because of timbre."

        common_misconceptions:
          - "Magnets attract all metals (only ferromagnetic metals: iron, nickel, cobalt)"
          - "Breaking a magnet gives separate N and S poles (each piece becomes a complete magnet with own N and S)"
          - "Attraction test confirms a magnet (WRONG — a magnet attracts iron too; REPULSION test confirms a magnet)"
          - "A compass needle is attracted by Earth's poles (it aligns with Earth's magnetic field)"
        key_formulas:
          - "Like poles repel (N-N, S-S)"
          - "Unlike poles attract (N-S)"

        example_problems:
          - problem: "You have an iron bar and a magnet. Both look identical. How do you find which is the magnet without using any other equipment?"
            answer: "Bring one end of bar A near the middle of bar B. If it attracts, swap and try. If one end attracts both ends AND the middle of the other bar, it's the iron bar. OR: Use repulsion test — only two magnets can repel."
            solution_steps:
              - "A magnet has strongest attraction at poles, weak at center"
              - "An iron bar is attracted uniformly"
              - "If bar A repels bar B at one end, bar A IS a magnet"
              - "Iron bars NEVER repel — only magnets can"

          - problem: "Why does a compass needle always point in the North-South direction?"
            answer: "Earth acts as a giant magnet. The compass needle (a small magnet) aligns with Earth's magnetic field, pointing North-South."
            solution_steps:
              - "A compass needle is a small magnet free to rotate"
              - "Earth has a magnetic field (behaves like a giant bar magnet)"
              - "The N pole of the compass is attracted toward Earth's geographic North"
              - "(Earth's magnetic South is near geographic North)"
              - "So compass always settles in North-South direction"

        prerequisites: ["ch07_t01"]
        difficulty_range: [1, 3]
        common_misconceptions:
          - "Current flows out of both terminals of a battery (current flows from + through circuit to -, completing the loop)"
          - "An open switch means the circuit is working (open switch = broken circuit = no current flows)"
          - "In a series circuit, the first bulb gets more current (current is SAME throughout a series circuit)"
          - "Parallel and series circuits have the same total resistance (parallel has LOWER total resistance)"

          - problem: "In a series circuit with 3 bulbs, what happens if one bulb fuses (breaks)?"
            answer: "All three bulbs go off. In a series circuit, the path is broken if any component fails."
            solution_steps:
              - "Series circuit: single path for current"
              - "If one bulb fuses, the circuit is broken at that point"
              - "No current can flow anywhere in the circuit"

          - problem: "Your home has a TV, fan, and tube light. Are they connected in series or parallel? How do you know?"
            answer: "Parallel. Because switching off one appliance doesn't affect the others."
            solution_steps:
              - "If series: switching off TV would also turn off fan and light (broken circuit)"
              - "But in your home, you can turn off TV while fan keeps running"
              - "This means each appliance has its own independent path for current"
              - "This is parallel connection"
              - "Also: each appliance gets the same voltage (220V in India)"
            difficulty: 1
            indian_context: "Every Indian home uses 220V parallel wiring — each switch controls one appliance independently."

          - problem: "Why are household appliances connected in parallel and not in series?"
            answer: "Three reasons: (1) Each appliance gets full voltage, (2) failure of one doesn't affect others, (3) each can be independently switched on/off"
            solution_steps:
              - "1. Same voltage: Each appliance gets 220V (Indian standard)"
              - "2. Independent operation: One fusing doesn't affect others"
              - "3. Individual switches: Each appliance can be controlled separately"
              - "In series: voltage divides, one failure breaks all, no individual control"
            difficulty: 2
            indian_context: "Indian homes use 220V AC with MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) for safety — all parallel."
